잘 놀다 갑니다.

## For the config, go to https://mastercomfig.com to get the latest version

My custom folder should be outdated at the time you are looking at this.

Go to https://mastercomfig.com to get one.

I saved it here because I'm too lazy to actually visit the site.

## Flat textures

Original link: https://gamebanana.com/mods/295065

yes it is copy & paste.

The purpose is to prevent losing it forever in case of original file getting deleted.

## Headsfeet & No hats

Original: https://gamebanana.com/mods/205768 (no hats), https://files.catbox.moe/z05j7c.vpk (headsfeet) 

yes it is copy & paste.

The purpose is to prevent losing it forever in case of original file getting deleted.

I only use it to remove stattracks.

## Huds

most huds are from https://tf2huds.dev/. I suggest you to visit it instead of downloading huds from here without searching it.

Other huds are probably from pktf2. She's (or was, since she has almost quitted TF2 too.) good at editing hud, and they all look nice.

## z01 file

I needed to separately compress some files. Download all .zip file and .z01 (and more) then unzip .zip file. It will work fine.
