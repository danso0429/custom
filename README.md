My custom folder MIGHT be outdated at the time you are looking at this.

Go to https://mastercomfig.com to get one.

I saved it here because I'm too lazy to actually visit the site.

yes it is copy & paste. The purpose is to prevent losing it forever in case of original file getting deleted.

## Headsfeet & No hats

Original: https://gamebanana.com/mods/205768 (no hats), https://files.catbox.moe/z05j7c.vpk (headsfeet)

# No misc

Original link: https://gamebanana.com/mods/470051

this mod gets rid of stattracks, canteens, etc..

"No hats extra" file in the "no hats" folder includes the mod that removes action items, so it's your choice to use it or not.

I only use it to remove stattarcks.

## Huds

most huds are from https://tf2huds.dev/. I suggest you to visit it instead of downloading huds from here without searching it.

## No dominations

Original link: https://gamebanana.com/mods/298459

It just changes the sounds of dominating/getting dominated sounds.

I'm slowly working on deleting the domination killfeed image.
